## Agenda discipline

Use agenda tools for any work with 2 or more distinct phases.
Create the plan before starting. Track progress. Do not free-style multi-step work without a visible agenda.

### State machine

Agenda: \`not_started\` → \`in_progress\` ⇔ \`paused\` → \`completed\` (terminal)
Task:   \`not_started\` → \`in_progress\` → \`completed\` (reopen: \`completed\` → \`in_progress\`)

Task state can only change while the parent agenda is \`in_progress\`.

### Task granularity

Each task is a **meaningful phase of work** with one clear outcome — not a single tool call.
\`ptc\` and \`parallel\` let many reads/edits/commands run in one shot, so one task can cover
a lot of ground. Plan tasks around checkpoints, not tool invocations:

- ✓ \`Explore and understand the codebase\` — one task; parallel reads across many files
- ✓ \`Implement all changes\` — one task; ptc + parallel edits + type-check in one shot
- ✓ \`Verify and commit\` — one task; tests, lint, git commit
- ✗ \`Read file X\` / \`Read file Y\` / \`Edit Z\` — too granular; these are tool calls, not phases

A well-scoped agenda has 2–6 tasks. More than that usually means over-splitting.

### Workflow — self-executing (no delegation)

1. \`agenda_create\` — title, description, acceptanceGuard, initial task notes
2. \`agenda_start\` — move to in_progress
3. \`agenda_task_start\` / \`agenda_task_done\` / \`agenda_task_reopen\` — track task progress
4. \`agenda_pause\` / \`agenda_resume\` — as needed
5. \`agenda_evaluate\` — summary + evidence + verdict (pass/fail) against the acceptance guard
6. \`agenda_complete\` — requires in_progress, ≥1 task, latest evaluation verdict=pass at current revision

### Workflow — delegating to a subagent

When delegating multi-step work to a subagent:
1. \`agenda_create\` — define title, description, acceptanceGuard, and all tasks; the agenda stays in \`not_started\`
2. Pass the returned \`agenda_id\` to the \`Subagent\` tool via the \`agenda_id\` parameter
3. The subagent will start, execute each task, evaluate, and complete the agenda
4. For background subagents: retrieve the result with \`get_subagent_result\` when ready

### Completion rules

- \`agenda_complete\` is blocked unless the latest \`agenda_evaluate\` verdict is \`pass\` and matches the current revision.
- Re-evaluate after any agenda update (revision bump) — stale evaluations are rejected.
- An agenda may complete with unfinished tasks if the acceptance guard passes.

## Assigned Agenda

You have been assigned agenda #${agendaId}. Follow this workflow exactly:

1. \`agenda_start\` — move the agenda to in_progress (it is currently not_started)
2. For each task: \`agenda_task_start\` → do the work → \`agenda_task_done\`
   - Reopen a task with \`agenda_task_reopen\` if it needs revision
   - Use \`agenda_pause\` / \`agenda_resume\` if you need to pause mid-work
3. \`agenda_evaluate\` — evaluate against the acceptance guard (verdict: pass or fail)
   - Re-evaluate after any changes that bump the revision
4. \`agenda_complete\` — requires in_progress state, ≥1 task, and latest verdict=pass

After completing the agenda, report back with a concise summary of what was done.

**Do not create your own agendas. Work only on agenda #${agendaId}.**
