# subagents

Spawn autonomous sub-agents for parallel and delegated work. Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated session with its own tools, model, system prompt, and turn budget.

## LLM tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `Subagent` | Launch a sub-agent (foreground or background) |
| `get_subagent_result` | Check status and retrieve results from a background agent |
| `steer_subagent` | Inject a steering message into a running agent mid-run |

### `Subagent` parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | Task for the agent |
| `description` | string | Short label shown in the UI (3–5 words) |
| `subagent_type` | string | Agent type name (case-insensitive) |
| `model` | string? | Model override — `"provider/modelId"` or fuzzy (`"haiku"`, `"sonnet"`) |
| `thinking` | string? | Thinking level: `off` `minimal` `low` `medium` `high` `xhigh` |
| `max_turns` | number? | Turn limit for this run |
| `run_in_background` | boolean? | Return immediately, notify on completion |
| `resume` | string? | Agent ID to resume from |
| `isolated` | boolean? | Strip extension/MCP tools — built-in tools only |
| `inherit_context` | boolean? | Prepend parent conversation history to prompt |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/subagents` | Open interactive management menu |

## Agent definitions

Agents are defined as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. On first install, the bundled defaults are seeded to `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (never overwritten once present).

**Discovery order** (higher priority wins):
1. Project: `.pi/agents/<name>.md`
2. Global: `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`

### Bundled agents

| Name | Model | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `general-purpose` | inherits parent | append | Full tools, general coding tasks |
| `Explore` | grok-code-fast-1 | replace | Read-only codebase exploration |
| `Plan` | claude-haiku-4-5 | replace | Read-only architecture planning |

### Frontmatter reference

```yaml
---
description: One-line description shown in UI
display_name: Display Name
tools: read, bash, grep, find, ls    # or "none" for no built-in tools
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5   # omit to inherit parent model
thinking: low                        # off | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh
max_turns: 30                        # omit for unlimited
prompt_mode: replace                 # replace = body is full prompt | append = appended to parent
extensions: false                    # true | false | csv of extension names
enabled: true

## Widget

While agents are running, a live widget appears **above the editor**:

```
● Subagents
├─ ⠸ general-purpose  refactor auth  ·  ⟳3  ·  12 tools  ·  8.4s
│    ⎿  editing…
└─ ◦ Explore  find deprecated  ·  queued
```

A status bar indicator shows `N running subagents` while agents are active.

## Turn limits

1. At `max_turns`, a steer message is injected: *"You have reached your turn limit. Wrap up immediately."*
2. If the agent doesn't finish within an additional **5 grace turns** (configurable), it is forcefully aborted.

Aborted agents have status `aborted` and return their last assistant text as a partial result.

## Concurrency

Background agents are subject to a concurrency limit (default: **4**). Excess agents queue and start automatically as slots free. Foreground agents always bypass the queue.

## Session viewer

Every agent session is recorded in memory — turns, tool calls with input/result summaries, and assistant text. Open via `/subagents → Subagents → <agent> → View session`. Auto-refreshes every 300ms while running.

## Skill

The `subagents` skill is auto-registered and guides the LLM on when to delegate, how to run parallel work, and how to use resume and steer.
